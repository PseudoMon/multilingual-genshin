# Multilingual Genshin Database
This is the repo containing the source code *and* all the data included in [Multilingual Genshin Database](https://multilingual-genshin.netlify.app). 

You can find all text data in the `public/data` directory. Images can be found in `public/images`. Feel free to grab and use these data for your needs. Credit back is appreciated but not necessary.

The `app` directory contains the source code used to build the site. The site is built with [Remix](https://remix.run) and its current iteration is deployed on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). 

Text data are gathered from [Dimbreath's repository](https://github.com/Dimbreath/GenshinData). Images came from various sources, including [Genshin Impact Wiki on Fandom](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/), [Paimon.moe](https://paimon.moe), and [Honey Impact](https://genshin.honeyhunterworld.com). All these data came from the live version of Genshin Impact, a game created by Hoyoverse.

This is a fan-project unaffiliated with Hoyoverse, meant primarily for educational purpose.
